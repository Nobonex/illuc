# illuc

illuc is a desktop app for agentic AI coding workflows. It helps you spin up
and manage focused coding tasks, each in its own workspace, so an AI agent can
work in isolation without stepping on other changes. You can start a task,
hand it to codex, and keep an eye on what it’s doing from a built-in terminal
view. When you want to jump in yourself, illuc can open the task directly in
VS Code or your system terminal.

The goal is to make agentic work feel organized and repeatable: tasks are
tracked, outputs are visible, and each task lives in a clean workspace you can
review or discard. It’s built for people who want to collaborate with an AI
agent while staying in control of the codebase.
