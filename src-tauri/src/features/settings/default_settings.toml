# This file is created automatically in the OS config directory on first run.
# On Linux this follows XDG (typically ~/.config/<app-id>/settings.toml).
#
# The active theme is selected by name and loaded from <config-dir>/themes/<theme>.toml.
#
# theme = "amber-terminal"
# Uncomment `theme` to force a theme. If omitted, Illuc defaults to the system light/dark preference.
